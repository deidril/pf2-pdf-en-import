        Can you / will you make import for <i>KingMaker</i>, <i>Blood Lords</i>, 
        <i>any content covered by a premium module</i> ?
    </b></p>

    <p>
        No. The premium modules are a very good job. As long as they are, as a lonely programmer 
        working on his module on his spare time, I'm not trying to do better than a full experienced team.

        I would like, but right now the import still takes too much time to do the new stuff and some of the old stuff.
        I'm spending a part of the coding time to imrprove this.
        There was ovbious progress since my first import, but before considering an import of 6 books of 100 pages,
        i need to divide the import time by 4 or so. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Also, I don't have most of the PDFs you are asking for. I have either the french version, either 
        the hardcover version.

    <p><b>If you're missing the PDFs, why not setting up a patreon or so ?</b></p>
    <p>
        That was my plan for January 2023, before the OGL sheet storm started.
        Let's speak of that once the path in the storm is clear.

    <p><b>IF you're missing the PDFs, why not using versions found on the web ?</b></p>
    <p>
        First, they are pirated PDFs and i won't use them. 
    </p>
    <p>    
        Second, my module imports contents using their position (I call that <i>their indexes</i>) in the pdf file.
        Therefore, any official pdfs would not work, because texts and images would be at another index. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Let's say you edit an official PDF to modify one letter and save it again. 
        There is chances you use a different PDF software version
        than the one used for the original version. Your indexes will be different and the import will fail.
        It means also if Paizo updates a supported PDF, there is chance the import fails with the updated version.
        So, <b>KEEP YOUR ORIGINAL PDF IF YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO IMPORT THEM, UNTIL YOU ARE NOTIFIED THE MODULE
            SUPPORT THE NEW PDF. 
        </b>

        Why not using pdf2foundry datas to import the old stuff ?
    </b></p>
    <p>
        <i><b>pdf2foundry</i></b> works another way. Its logic is mostly immune to slight changes in the pdf as well to 
        changes of the pdf javascript lib used. 
        So from a certain point of view, it is a better software.
    </p>
    <p>
        However i did my module to have the output it has right now, and wanted to do it by myself to learn 
        javascript. I'm a C++ programmer and wanted to improve my knowledge of javascript through this project.
        Moving toward pdf2foundry logic while keeping the output used for the journals ?
        It would be a smart move for the module but it would need a lot of time. I started things to do this but it's still
        a long way.
    </p>

    <p>Also remember the first version of my module is from July 2022. It will takes time to have the same content and features
        than pdf2foundry.

        Anyway to speed up the import ? How can I help you ? Can I make also import ?
    </b></p>

    <p>
        The biggest time sink is making the maps with their walls. 
        Foundry modules with high quality maps covering current imports or future imports would be 
        the biggest help possible.  
    </p>

    <p>
        Making an import is a several step process that need knowledge of the javascript programming language, 
        as well as the internal structure of a pdf, and is a software to learn by itself.
        Making graphical user interfaces for all the steps, writing the documentation or making tutorial videos, 
        and answering questions would be a full time job. There is things everybody can do to help like 
        making modules with high quality maps, and except a few people, it's not done because people miss 
        time or knowledge. I think setting up an available software to configure import of a given pdf would not provide
        more imports to the community because the time and the technical knowledge needed is bigger than the one needed to make
        map modules.   
    </p>

<div>
    <p><b>
        Why is your module's javascript code crypted or so ?
    </b></p>

    <p>It's called <i><b>obfuscation</i></b>. It is a request from <i><b>Foundry</i></b> so it's not trivial to 
        remove the check of the PDF watermarks.
