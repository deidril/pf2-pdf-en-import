**New Imports**
The module can now import *Pathfinder Society Season 3 Episode 15 : Cavern of the Sundered Song*.

**Fixes**
* PFS3E14 has been itemized
* All items from compendiums are now directly linked in journal entries and there is no more imports

**Short term**
* A v10 version is more or less ready. I'm waiting for a stable v10 pf2e system to complete it. I'll give an url to test it asap.
* Next import will be *Pathfinder Society Season 4 Introduction*. I'll come back to season 3 later.
