# Deidril's Pathfinder 2 PDF Import v1.12-v10-beta1

This is a foundry v10 compatible version. It does nothing more than being compatible with v10 version.
There is no (yet) use of the new journal features.

The version isn't released on foundry yet but is available through direct download.

Known bugs are :

- You may need to import PFS3E15 twice to make it work. First time it will stop after importing images
- HTML issue : Some elements are reported as section in the v10 section index while they shouldn't
- CSS isues : Some elements are packed and need some spaces between
